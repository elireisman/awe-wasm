awe-wasm = awesome WASM - repo for tracking WASM related resources I come across while bringing myself up to speed on this new ecosystem.

## Introductory articles on WASM and its ecosystem
* [Standardizing WASI: A system interface to run WebAssembly outside the web](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/), 2019-03-27 - [Lin Clark](https://twitter.com/linclark) walks throuh WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) - a proposed standard library system for WASM designed to provide core, modular libraries for WASM apps.  The proposal is being tracked [here](https://wasi.dev/).

## Tutorials
* [WASM by example](https://wasmbyexample.dev/) - [Aaron Turner](https://aaronthedev.com/) has built a tutorial that walks through WASM from first concepts to workings with graphics, with examples in both Rust and Typescript.

## Frameworks and libraries
* [Smithy.rs](https://www.smithy.rs/) - Rust framework for writing idiomatic WebAssembly web applications.

## Prominent community members
* [Lin Clark](https://twitter.com/linclark) - Mozilla developer focusing on WebAssembly and Rust who has written many great articles linked above.
* [Till Schneidereit](https://twitter.com/tschneidereit) - Manager at Mozilla working on the WebAssembly efforts.

## Books and other resources
* [WASM Weekly](https://wasmweekly.news/) - A weekly newsletter (with all its previous issues archived online) of WASM-related news.
* [Programming WebAssembly with Rust](https://pragprog.com/book/khrust/programming-webassembly-with-rust) by [Kevin Hoffman](https://twitter.com/KevinHoffman).  Covers WebAssembly from the ground up with a focus on using Rust to write apps.
